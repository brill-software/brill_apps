<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>A workspace is a set of directories on the server that hold a copy of the repository.</p>
<p>If you wish to make some changes, use your own private workspace.</p>
<p>The <code><strong>development</strong></code> workspace is normally set to contain the <code><strong>develop</strong></code> branch from the repository.</p>
<p>The production system uses the <code><strong>production</strong></code> workspace, which is normally set to the <code><strong>master</strong></code> branch from the repository.</p>
