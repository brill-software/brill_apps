<h1>Brill Software License Agreement</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Brill Software Proprietry License (BSPL) is aimed at preventing other companies from taking the Brill CMS and Brill Framework and providing the product directly as a service, without collaborating with us. We're reminded of the brilliant Netflix film called "The Billion Dollar Code" that dramatizes the legal battle between Terravision and Google over Google Earth. We're happy for other developers to use generic packages and modules from our source code in their own developments, should they be useful. But we also need to make a living and earn money to enable to our products to be developed further.</p>
<p>Large organizations can save substantial sums of money by using our "low code" approach and can therefore justify paying for licenses. For personal use, non-commercial projects and small businesses, the Brill CMS and Brill Framework are free. Hopefully some of the people using the product for free will contribute something back to the project in the way of feedback, details of bugs and ideas for enhancing the product.</p>
<h3>Copyright notices</h3>
<p>The first line of each module contains a copyright notice that indicates whether the module is covered by the Brill Software Proprietry License or the MIT License.</p>
<p>Modules distributed under the Brill Software Proprietry Licesne have the following first line:</p>

<h3>MIT Licensed Modules</h3>
<p>Where we think a package or module could be useful to others in the development of their software and where the code is not specific to Brill Software, we've used the MIT license.</p>
<p>The following packages and modules come under the MIT license</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java code for database jdbc connection pooling and returning query results as JSON.</li>
  <li>Java code for accessing a git respository, based on top of the Eclipse JGit library.</li>
  <li>Typescript client code for a WebSockets Message Broker.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to copy and use the MIT licensed code in any way you wish. You can copy it directly into your project, modify it, put it into a library, distribute it and do anything you want without restriction. The code comes without any warranty or gaurantee of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>The MIT licensed code isn't packaged into libraries and you may need to add some dependencies to your build process and do some additional work. Should you wish, you can provide details of any bugs found to Brill Software. &nbsp;Should a fix be generally appplicable, we will endevour to include the fix in a future release.</p>
<p>Should there be any modules that are marked as proprietry, but which you would like to use under the MIT license, please get in touch and we'll see if we can accomodate.</p>
<h2>Brill Software Proprietry Licensed (BSPL) Modules</h2>
<h3>Source Code availablity</h3>
<p>All the Brill Software Proprietry Licensed (BSPL) source code is available for download and inspection. It is open for you to view and ispect. This is so that you can check the quality of the code, check that there are no security flaws, malware or backdoors, debug issues and so that you have confidence in what we do. The code is "source available", rather than "Open Source".</p>
<h3>Community, Enterprise and Distributor Licensing</h3>
<p>We've copied the new Docker model for licensing our software. It's free for personal use, non-commercial projects and small businesses with fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million USD in annual revenue. If you quality under the free use, you come under the Community Licensing. Should you work for a large company, organisation or government department, you come under the Enterprise Licensing. The Distributor licensing is for if you wish to re-sell our products or provide a SaaS offering similar to WordPress or Wix.</p>

<p>You can request support on a Time and Material basis, but there's no obligation on the part of Brill Software to provide support. We will do our best to help but we not have resources available to help.</p>
<p>You can modify the BSPL source code for your own use or application. We recommend adding your own copyright line at the start of each module to indicate changed modules.
